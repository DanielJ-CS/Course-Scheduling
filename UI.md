To build and launch the UI, do the following in the project root directory:

1. Configure the project by `npm run configure` or `npm run configurewin` (if using Windows)

2. Build the project by `npm run buildall`

3. Run all tests by `npm run test` (this will PUT the datasets, otherwise UI won't work)

4. Start REST server by `npm run start`

5. Open `index.html`
